My Portfolio will be mostly text with short descriptions of each project, along with screenshots that give a glimpse of the best parts of each project. There will be links leading to each project. For the poem project will be a direct link to the poem, for the greenscreen project a small demo will be embedded into the page, and for the nonlinear narrative project I will imbed the game into the page.
