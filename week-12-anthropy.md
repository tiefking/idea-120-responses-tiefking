Video games need more diversity because there is a vast audience of people that play video games. An expected target audience does not exactly mean that is the actual audience for a video game, and since so many games lack diversity the large portion of players are forced to buy these games lacking in diversity.Diversity leads to more creativity, and would put video games apart from one another and appeal to more people. There are so many types of people in the world, it’s boring if every game is based on the same type of person.

Video games also need to be more accessible to all sorts of people, game controls can be overly complicated and a lot of video games can have seizure inducing visual effects. As a form of entertainment, nobody should have to be left out of the equation because it’s physically difficult or could harm them.

Coding in video games needs to be more diverse to be more accessible to all sorts of people. There should be different ways for the same game to be played, more configuration options, and less unnecessary hand positions.

The people who code these games also need to be more diverse, because the same group of people making those games will lead to more carbon copy games being released. The more creativity on the creation team would lead to more creativity and diversity in the actual games.
