Is it possible to make a new genre of video game?
How could somebody design a game with more soft rules?
How well video games do in conveying certain experiences?
Video games have come daily far, so a lot of experiences can be replicated in a near one to one fashion.Though depending on how it is designed or who is designing the game would depend on if all aspects of the experience are expressed to players.

Some things can easily get lost in design translation, and express the wrong thing. Especially more serious topics and games can accidentally glorify bad things. This is a problem in a lot of other mediums, but since games have become more visual, a lot  of games just show the players the experience and not much else at times. Or move on entirely.

A lot of care should be taken when it comes to conveying certain experiences in game, especially in a market controlled by a small demographic of people.
